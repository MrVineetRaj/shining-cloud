# Shining Cloud

## Hey ! I am Vineet Raj from NSUT main Campus

I created one Cloud application where you can store data online an access it whenever you need , created using [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and used [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) as data base to store data about user and folders associated with it ,

Also used [next auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) as it is easy to use and also provide strong authentication

### You can copy and run this project using these command in project directory

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

everything will be installed and you are good to go ,
Yea I know it's very easy

But, Don't forget to configure environment variables in your .env.local file.

otherwise project will never run

# Happy Coding!
